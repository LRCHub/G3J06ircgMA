The curtain's a sea anemone
In the way it sways to the slow breeze
I lie spread out on the floor, looking at these things
Most of them are yours

And it's so nice
Sitting very still
Without those old shoes
I could never fill

Starfish with its arms out in a daze
Staring at the stars through an ocean haze
Was I one you wished upon, burned out like a light bulb
When you turned me on

And it's so nice
Sleeping here all alone
With my ashtray
White courtesy telephone

Now I'm making out the shapes
Like the shower rod, can it take my weight?
I will tell you I am fine
I got some news, friend, feels like I'm dying

Turtle on its back in the desert sea
And you look like a cool drink just slightly out of reach
Draw myself into the shell
Waiting on a sign from God or a nod from hell

And it's so nice
Sitting very still
Without those old shoes
I could never fill

Now we're turning on the lights
It's the first day of my second life
Take my name off of the lease
You can even keep the name, it never suited me
