Slip fast from focus
Spotlights won't notice
My darkest totem
If you could help me out, you could help me out

Plucked from an ocean
Immersed in commotion
I'm mixing potions
If you could help me out, you could help me out

I melt right into my seat
You gave me just what I need
I'm falling back to the sea
Retaste the salt on my teeth
I'm through the floor to my knees
You gave me just what I need
I'm flowing out through the streets
I'm sinking straight in the deep

Spotlights won't notice
My darkest totem
I'm mixing potions
If you could help me out, you could help me out

I melt right into my seat
You gave me just what I need
I'm falling back to the sea
Retaste the salt on my teeth
I'm through the floor to my knees
You gave me just what I need
I'm flowing out through the streets
I'm sinking straight in the deep

Come closer in the deep

Even if I'm drunk on Sunday morning wine
Even if immortalized I'd miss the reef
Even if I am laid out on white sheets
I've never felt alive in company
